# PiRack OLED Script
This script is based on Adafruit's OLED script, but has been modified to use a 128x64 OLED and a pushbutton.
It's designed to be used with a raspberry pi server rack.

Installation Instructions are pulled from the Adafruit Website.

## Prerequisite Pi Setup!

In this page we'll assume you've already gotten your Raspberry Pi up and running and can log into the command line

Here's the quick-start for people with some experience:

1. Download the latest Raspbian or Raspbian Lite to your computer
2. Burn the Raspbian image to your MicroSD card using your computer
3. Re-plug the SD card into your computer (don't use your Pi yet!) and set -up your wifi connection by editing supplicant.conf
4. Activate SSH support
5. Plug the SD card into the Pi
6. If you have an HDMI monitor we recommend connecting it so you can see that the Pi is booting OK
7. Plug in power to the Pi - you will see the green LED flicker a little. The Pi will reboot while it sets up so wait a good 10 minutes.
8. If you are running Windows on your computer, install Bonjour support so you can use .local names, you'll need to reboot Windows after installation
9. You can then ssh into raspberrypi.local

## Update Your Pi and Python

Run the standard updates:

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get upgrade`

and

`sudo pip3 install --upgrade setuptools`

If above doesn't work try

`sudo apt-get install python3-pip`

## Enable I2C and SPI

Tutorial on how to turn I2C & SPI on.
https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/enable-spi-i2c-raspberry-pi/

You only have to do this once per Raspberry Pi but by default both interfaces are disabled!

    * Enable I2C
    * Enable SPI

Once you're done with both and have rebooted, verify you have the I2C and SPI devices with the command

`ls /dev/i2c* /dev/spi*`

You should see the response

`/dev/i2c-1 /dev/spidev0.0 /dev/spidev0.1`

## Enabling Second SPI

If you are using the main SPI port for a display or something and need another hardware SPI port, you can enable it by adding the line

`dtoverlay=spi1-3cs`

to the bottom of '/boot/config.txt' and rebooting. You'll then see the addition of some '/dev/spidev1.x' devices:

## Make sure you're using Python 3!

The default python on your computer may not be python 3. Python 2 is officially discontinued and all our libraries are Python 3 only.

We'll be using python3 and pip3 in our commands, use those versions of python and pip to make sure you're using 3 and not 2

## Install Python libraries

Now you're ready to install all the python support

Run the following command to install the Raspberry PI GPIO library:

`pip3 install RPI.GPIO`

Run the following command to install adafruit_blinka

`pip3 install adafruit-blinka`

To install the library for the Pi OLED, enter the following into the terminal:

`sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306`

The computer will install a few different libraries such as adafruit-pureio (our ioctl-only i2c library), spidev (for SPI interfacing), Adafruit-GPIO (for detecting your board) and of course adafruit-blinka

That's pretty much it! You're now ready to test.

## Blinka Test

Create a new file called blinkatest.py with nano or your favorite text editor and put the following in:

```
import board
import digitalio
import busio
    
print("Hello blinka!")
    
# Try to great a Digital input
pin = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D4)
print("Digital IO ok!")
    
# Try to create an I2C device
i2c = busio.I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA)
print("I2C ok!")
    
# Try to create an SPI device
spi = busio.SPI(board.SCLK, board.MOSI, board.MISO)
print("SPI ok!")
    
print("done!")
```

Save it and run at the command line with

`python3 blinkatest.py`

You should see the following, indicating digital i/o, I2C and SPI all worked



To install the library for the Pi OLED, enter the following into the terminal:

`sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306`

If that complains about pip3 not being installed, then run this first to install it:

`sudo apt-get install python3-pip`

We also need PIL to allow using text with custom fonts. There are several system libraries that PIL relies on, so installing via a package manager is the easiest way to bring in everything:

`sudo apt-get install python3-pil`

## Enable I2C

To enable i2c, you can follow our detailed guide on configuring the Pi with I2C support here.

After you've enabled I2C you will need to shutdown with sudo shutdown -h now

Once the Pi has halted, plug in the PiOLED. Now you can power the Pi back up, and log back in. Run the following command from a terminal prompt to scan/detect the I2C devices

`sudo i2cdetect -y 1`

You should see the following, indicating that address 0x3c (the OLED display) was found

## Verify I2C Device

You can run our stats example, which will query the Pi for details on CPU load, disk space, etc. and print it on the OLED.

Clone the repository to your home folder

`git clone https://github.com/dorfman2/PiRackOled.git`

And enter it.

`cd PiRackOled/`

Run sudo python3 stats.py and you should see something.

## Running Stats on Boot

You can pretty easily make it so this handy program runs every time you boot your Pi.

The fastest/easiest way is to put it in `/etc/rc.local`

Run `sudo nano /etc/rc.local` and add the line

`sudo python3 /home/pi/PiRackOled/stats.py &`

on its own line right before exit 0

Then save and exit. Reboot to verify that the screen comes up on boot!
